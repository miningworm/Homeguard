Python Picamera Setup
A camera workshop written by Dave Jones (author of python-picamera), with some example projects.

Workshop

This workshop guides you through setting up the Raspberry Pi camera module, taking pictures and video using the Python picamera module, connecting a physical button with the GPIO pins and programming it to control the camera.

Connecting the camera

Locate the camera port next to the ethernet port
Lift the tab on the top
Place the strip in the connector (blue side facing the ethernet port)
While holding the strip in place, push down the tab
Activate the camera

Connect a USB cable to the power
Login with username pi and password raspberry
At the command prompt enter sudo raspi-config
At the menu, navigate to Enable Camera
Select Enable
Select Finish
Select Yes to reboot
Test the camera

Login again with username pi and password raspberry
At the command prompt enter raspistill -o image.jpg
On the screen you should see a preview appear for a few seconds, and then change briefly while the image is captured
Camera programming: capture an image

Start by installing the Python picamera and GPIO library packages:

sudo apt-get install python-picamera python3-picamera python-rpi.gpio
At the command prompt enter startx to start the graphical desktop environment
Double click on LXTerminal to start a command line, and enter sudo idle & to start the Python environment
Select File > New Window from the menu to start a text editor
Enter the following code (case is important!):

import time
import picamera

with picamera.PiCamera() as camera:
    camera.start_preview()
    time.sleep(5)
    camera.capture('/home/pi/Desktop/image.jpg')
    camera.stop_preview()
Select File > Save from the menu and give your script a name, e.g. workshop.py

Select Run > Run Module from the menu (or just press F5) to run the script
Camera programming: capture when activated

Connect the Pi to the button as shown in the diagram below:



In the text editor, import the RPi.GPIO module, set up GPIO pin 17 and change the sleep line to use GPIO.wait_for_edge like so:

import time
import picamera
import RPi.GPIO as GPIO  # new

GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BCM)  # new
GPIO.setup(17, GPIO.IN, GPIO.PUD_UP)  # new

with picamera.PiCamera() as camera:
    camera.start_preview()
    GPIO.wait_for_edge(17, GPIO.FALLING)  # new
    camera.capture('/home/pi/Desktop/image.jpg')
    camera.stop_preview()
Delete image.jpg from the desktop

Save and run your script
Once the preview has started, press the button connected to your Pi to capture an image
Camera programming: countdown capture (selfies!)

Modify your program to include the delay after the button wait:

import time
import picamera
import RPi.GPIO as GPIO

GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BCM)
GPIO.setup(17, GPIO.IN, GPIO.PUD_UP)

with picamera.PiCamera() as camera:
    camera.start_preview()
    GPIO.wait_for_edge(17, GPIO.FALLING)
    time.sleep(5)  # new
    camera.capture('/home/pi/Desktop/image.jpg')
    camera.stop_preview()
Delete image.jpg from the desktop

Save and run your script
Press the button and try to take a selfie
Camera programming: camcorders

Modify your program to record video instead:

import time
import picamera
import RPi.GPIO as GPIO

GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BCM)
GPIO.setup(17, GPIO.IN, GPIO.PUD_UP)

with picamera.PiCamera() as camera:
    camera.start_preview()
    GPIO.wait_for_edge(17, GPIO.FALLING)
    camera.start_recording('/home/pi/Desktop/video.h264')
    time.sleep(1)
    GPIO.wait_for_edge(17, GPIO.FALLING)
    camera.stop_recording()
    camera.stop_preview()
Save and run your script

Press the button to start recording video; press it again to stop and exit the program
Camera programming: circular buffers

Modify your program to continually record to a circular buffer, and write it to disk when the button is pressed:

import io
import time
import picamera
import RPi.GPIO as GPIO

GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BCM)
GPIO.setup(17, GPIO.IN, GPIO.PUD_UP)

with picamera.PiCamera() as camera:
    stream = picamera.PiCameraCircularIO(camera, seconds=20)
    camera.start_preview()
    camera.start_recording(stream, format='h264')
    GPIO.wait_for_edge(17, GPIO.FALLING)
    camera.stop_recording()
    camera.stop_preview()
    for frame in stream.frames:
        if frame.header:
            stream.seek(frame.position)
            break
    with io.open('/home/pi/Desktop/video.h264', 'wb') as output:
        while True:
            data = stream.read1()
            if not data:
                break
            output.write(data)
Delete video.h264 from the desktop

Save and run your script
Press the button to save the last 20+ seconds of video to the drive
Camera Project Ideas

The tasks presented in the workshop may seem basic, but with some simple alterations they can form the basis for numerous interesting projects:

Time-lapse photography

A time-lapse sequence can be easily constructed by running the basic capture program in a loop, and adjusting the delay to the gap required. Timelapse sequences can be used to visualise many natural processes that are not easy to see otherwise such as plant growth and decay, long term construction projects and weather cycles. Here is some example code:

import time
import picamera

VIDEO_DAYS = 5
FRAMES_PER_HOUR = 1
FRAMES = FRAMES_PER_HOUR * 24 * VIDEO_DAYS

def capture_frame(frame):
    with picamera.PiCamera() as cam:
        time.sleep(2)
        cam.capture('/home/pi/Desktop/frame%03d.jpg' % frame)

# Capture the images
for frame in range(FRAMES):
    # Note the time before the capture
    start = time.time()
    capture_frame(frame)
    # Wait for the next capture. Note that we take into
    # account the length of time it took to capture the
    # image when calculating the delay
    time.sleep(
        int(60 * 60 / FRAMES_PER_HOUR) - (time.time() - start)
    )
Once the images have been captured you can use the following FFMPEG command line to construct a video from the images, after installing ffmpeg with sudo apt-get install ffmpeg:

ffmpeg -y -f image2 -i /home/pi/Desktop/frame%03d.jpg -r 24 -vcodec libx264 -profile high -preset slow /home/pi/Desktop/timelapse.mp4
Be aware that encoding will take at least half an hour of computation on the Pi to produce the video! You may wish to perform this step on a faster machine.

Stop-motion animation

In a similar vein, it's quite easy to construct a stop-motion animation system with the Pi's camera. The "capture when activated" program can be run in a loop (as in the timelapse program above) to continually capture images when the button is pressed. The same FFMPEG command line can then be used to construct the final video. The major challenge with stop-motion animation is keeping the camera and the target scene sufficiently static. Here is some example code:

import picamera
import RPi.GPIO as GPIO

GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BCM)
GPIO.setup(17, GPIO.IN, GPIO.PUD_UP)

with picamera.PiCamera() as camera:
    camera.start_preview()
    frame = 1
    while True:
        GPIO.wait_for_edge(17, GPIO.FALLING)
        camera.capture('/home/pi/Desktop/frame%03d.jpg' % frame)
        frame += 1
    camera.stop_preview()
Once the frames have all been captured, a similar FFMPEG command line to the one presented above can be used to convert the frames into a video:

ffmpeg -y -f image2 -i /home/pi/Desktop/frame%03d.jpg -r 24 -vcodec libx264 -profile high -preset slow /home/pi/Desktop/stop_motion.mp4
Security cameras

A variety of security cameras can be built using the techniques in the workshop. By replacing the button with a pressure mat or an infrared motion sensor, you can convert either the "capture when activated" or "circular buffers" programs into security cameras. The first will capture an image when activated, the second will capture the 20 seconds of activity leading up to the sensor being activated.

Build your own camera/camcorder

By attaching a battery to the Pi, you can construct a hand-held point-and-shoot camera quite easily using the "capture when activated" program above. For basic projects, use a physical view-finder. However, advanced students may want to try their hand at constructing a full-blown digital camera. The Adafruit site has an excellent guide here:

Colour and shape detection

Colour detection is relatively simple, provided you are happy using rudimentary statistics on an array of numbers. Capturing an image and accessing it as an array of numbers is demonstrated in the "raw image capture" guides in the documentation:

http://picamera.readthedocs.org/en/release-1.2/recipes2.html

Shape detection is harder, but certain libraries (OpenCV in particular) have built-in routines for detecting various shapes like circles. These could be used to construct a system which performs actions in response to being shown certain colours or shapes; a bit like training an animal, but with more maths involved!

Motion detection

An idea for more talented pupils is to see if they can detect motion simply using the camera itself; in other words, without resorting to an external sensor. Several examples can be found online without too much difficulty, but the code is definitely not aimed at beginners. Once implemented, this project can be extended into a security camera with no external components other than the camera module itself.
